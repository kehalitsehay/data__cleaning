## Data_cleaning
In this project, I have cleaned a Customer Call  List.xlsx dataset. This dataset is come from "Alex the Analyst". Thank you for your support.

Here is the summary of what I have done in this project.
1. The Last_Name column of the dataset contains unwanted special characters, and hence I have removed those characters using .str.strip() method.
2. The Phone_Number column of the dataset was not standardized and through some manipulation I have changed it to the standard layout
3. The Address column was not clear and I have managed it.
4. Finally, I have removed those customers whose phone number was not registered and those customers who don't want to contact us.
